Apps and websites that offer YouTube video and audio downloading can still function without requiring users to provide a cookies file by employing several strategies to bypass or adapt to YouTube’s recent bot restrictions. While your experience with Python-based methods (like youtube-dl or yt-dlp) hitting roadblocks due to these restrictions is common, the underlying principles these tools use can shed light on how other services manage to operate. Here’s how they likely do it:
	1	Server-Side Processing: Many of these apps and websites offload the downloading process to their own servers. Instead of relying on the user’s device to directly interact with YouTube, the user submits a video URL to the service, and the server handles the request. These servers can be configured to mimic human-like behavior (e.g., using headless browsers or custom HTTP requests) to avoid triggering YouTube’s bot detection, which often relies on patterns like rapid requests or missing browser-like headers. By doing this server-side, they don’t need the user’s cookies—they generate their own session data or use alternative authentication methods.
	2	Reverse Engineering YouTube’s API: YouTube’s front-end and API endpoints are constantly changing, but skilled developers reverse-engineer the requests made by the official YouTube website or app. Tools like youtube-dl and yt-dlp historically worked by parsing the video page’s HTML or JSON responses to extract direct media URLs (e.g., the raw MP4 or audio streams). While bot restrictions have tightened, some services stay ahead by frequently updating their code to match YouTube’s latest obfuscation techniques, such as the “rolling cipher” method used to obscure download links. They don’t need cookies if they can directly access these streams without authentication.
	3	Proxying and IP Rotation: To evade bot detection, which often flags repetitive requests from the same IP or user agent, these services use proxy networks or rotate IP addresses. This makes their traffic appear as if it’s coming from multiple unique users rather than a single automated source. By combining this with randomized user agents and request timing, they can bypass restrictions that might otherwise demand cookies or sign-in verification.
	4	Privacy-Enhanced Mode or Public Endpoints: Some services exploit YouTube’s privacy-enhanced mode (e.g., youtube-nocookie.com) or other public-facing endpoints that don’t require full user authentication. While these may not always provide the highest quality streams, they can still deliver downloadable content without needing cookies, as they’re designed to minimize tracking rather than enforce strict access controls.
	5	Avoiding Age-Restricted or Sign-In Walls: For videos that don’t require sign-in (e.g., non-age-restricted, publicly available content), these services can often grab the media files directly by mimicking a standard browser request. YouTube’s bot restrictions are stricter for protected content, but many videos remain accessible without cookies if the service can convincingly emulate a legitimate viewer.
As for why your Python methods are failing, recent updates to YouTube’s anti-bot measures—like requiring sign-in to “confirm you’re not a bot”—target automated tools specifically. Libraries like yt-dlp often need cookies (exported from a logged-in browser) to bypass these checks because they rely on client-side execution and can’t easily replicate the sophisticated server-side workarounds used by commercial services. However, even with Python, you might still succeed by:
	•	Using OAuth or Cookies: While you’re trying to avoid this, providing a cookies file or implementing OAuth2 authentication (as some yt-dlp plugins support) can resolve the issue by proving you’re a legitimate user.
	•	Updating Tools: Ensure you’re using the latest version of yt-dlp (e.g., nightly builds), as developers actively patch it to counter YouTube’s changes.
	•	Headless Browsers: Tools like Puppeteer or Selenium can automate a real browser to fetch video data, though this is slower and more resource-intensive.
In short, these apps and websites thrive by shifting the burden to their infrastructure, staying nimble with YouTube’s evolving protections, and targeting content that doesn’t demand user-specific authentication. For your Python woes, adapting to server-side techniques or reluctantly using cookies might be the path of least resistance given the current landscape as of March 30, 2025.
